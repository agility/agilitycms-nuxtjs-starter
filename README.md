## Notes

### How to Register Page Modules

To create a new Page Module, create a new Vue component within the `src/components/agility-pageModules` directory. Make sure the Vue component for the Page Module matches the name of the Page Module in the CMS.

Example of `RichTextArea.vue` Page Module:

```
<template>
  <div class="relative px-8">
    <div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto my-12 md:mt-18 lg:mt-20">
      <div class="prose max-w-full mx-auto" v-html="item.fields.textblob" />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    contentID: Number,
    item: Object,
    page: Object,
    pageInSitemap: Object,
    dynamicPageItem: Object,
  },
};
</script>
```

### How to Register Page Templates

To create a new Page Template, create a new Vue component within the `src/components/agility-pageTemplates` directory. Make sure the Vue component for the Page Template matches the name of the Page Template in the CMS.

Example of `MainTemplate.vue` Page Template:

```
<template>
  <ContentZone
    name="MainContentZone"
    :page="page"
    :pageInSitemap="pageInSitemap"
    :dynamicPageItem="dynamicPageItem"
    :moduleData="moduleData"
  />
</template>

<script>
import ContentZone from "../../AgilityContentZone";
export default {
  props: {
    page: Object,
    moduleData: Object,
    pageInSitemap: Object,
    dynamicPageItem: Object,
  },
  components: {
    ContentZone,
  },
};
</script>
```
